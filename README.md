# Virginia Tech Facebook Chatbot

This is my first personal project and first time programming in Javascript or Node.js. It is a webhook written in Node.js that communicates between Facebook Messenger, DialogFlow, and a database. Users can send the associated Facebook page questions. The webhook then performs the necessary functions and responds to the question. Currently, the project is under development. Additional features are being added constantly, and the codes is regularly being refactored as I learn more.

## Built With

* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - The web framework used
* [APIAI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apiai) - Used for message analysis
* [MongoDB](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/) - The database module used

## Versioning

All my versioning was done on GitHub. The test branch was used to develop features. Once it properly functioned, it was moved to the master branch.
